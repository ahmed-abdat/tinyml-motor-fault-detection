Data Collection:

Sensor Used: SG-Link tri-axial accelerometer sensor by MICROSTRAIN Corporation.

Sampling Rate: 679 samples per second for each of the three axes (axial, horizontal, and vertical).

Experiment Location: Mechanical Vibration Laboratory, Mechanical Engineering Department (MED), University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Taxila.

Working States: The experiment focused on four working states of the machinery:

Normal state
Cracking state
Offset pulley state
Wear state
**
Experimental Setup**: The experimental setup involves a test rig apparatus designed to simulate different fault conditions in machinery. The block diagram of the setup is shown in Figure (3) of the associated research paper.

Dataset Structure: The dataset is organized into folders corresponding to the three axes of vibration data:

x_axis/ - Contains vibration data along the x-axis (horizontal direction).
y_axis/ - Contains vibration data along the y-axis (vertical direction).
z_axis/ - Contains vibration data along the z-axis (depth or axial direction).



The dataset is provided as-is for research and educational purposes.
