## PROJECT CONTEXT
I am Ahmed Abdellahi Abdat, a Master's student in Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Automation at the Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, working on my final year engineering project (PFE) focused on "Caract√©risation des pannes dans les moteurs rotatifs utilisant TinyML" (Fault characterization in rotating motors using TinyML). The project involves:

1. Analyzing vibration data from rotating machinery (motors, pumps, etc.)
2. Implementing machine learning models to detect and classify different types of faults
3. Deploying these models on resource-constrained microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32) using TinyML techniques
4. Creating a complete embedded system for real-time fault detection

## MY BACKGROUND AND NEEDS
I have experience with:
- Programming in Python, C, Java, and VHDL
- Working with development boards: ESP32, STM32, Arduino
- Communication protocols: UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, LoRa/LoRaWAN, MQTT, CoAP
- Software tools: STM32CubeIDE, MATLAB Simulink, Proteus, Git, GitHub

I have previously worked on IoT projects involving environmental parameter monitoring using ESP32 and data visualization. However, I need help with:
- TinyML implementation specifics for vibration analysis
- Optimizing ML models for embedded deployment
- Processing vibration signals effectively
- Choosing appropriate features and algorithms for fault detection
- Creating efficient code that runs on microcontrollers for real-time analysis

## AVAILABLE RESOURCES
I have access to:
- The "Vibration Faults Dataset for Rotating Machines" dataset containing labeled normal and faulty states
- ESP32 microcontroller (which I'm already familiar with and will be the primary hardware platform for this project)
- Accelerometers (tri-axial) for data collection
- Edge Impulse platform, which will be the primary development tool for my TinyML implementation
